We have made a fun interactive game that analyses the motions of the user in real time.For this we have used a kinect sensor.

This video is of a game which detects if a user leans left or right and also jumps. The user has to move accordingly to navigate through this obstacle course.

The second video is for those who want their ordinary jogs turn extrordinary. The user can explore through beautiful environments which would take their breath away before the exhaustion does.
