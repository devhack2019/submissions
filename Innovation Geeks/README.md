Resources Used :-

Electronic Components - Arduino Uno, WiFi module, Servo motor, Ultrasonic Sensors
Hardware - PVC pipes, Dustbin, Stand

Ideas and Features :-

Automated Lid -	When the user comes in the proximity, the ultrasonic sensor detects it. Using this input the servo motor opens the lid.

Garbage Level Detection - The lid consists of an Ultrasonic Sensor, which detects the garbage level continuously. When the bin is full, an LED is switched ON. Also the Automated Lid Mechanism is deactivated so that no more garbage can be put.

Information Transfer - The output whether the bin is full or not is transferred to MySQL database server through the wifi module and the information is the website then uses this information for alerting the driver, so that he can ceollect the waste from the alerted location.

Dustbin Emptying Mechanism - The dustbin is attached to a pivoted arm. When the garbage collector comes to empty the bin, he can press a switch on the stand of the dustbin. The switch mechanism rotates the arm and the bin is emptied into the vehicle.

Mobility of the Dustbin - The dustbin is mounted on the stand, which has castor wheels, and hence can be moved easily.
