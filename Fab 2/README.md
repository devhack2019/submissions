<!--Eco power saver
our project mainly focuses on saving the light energy
we designed a device which turns the light on when sunlight is not sufficient to illuminate a room
and turn it off when there is enough sunlight and also
adjusts light in the room according to the intensity of the sunlight.
It will be a great help to the users who repeatedly forget to turn the light off when they are leaving the room
